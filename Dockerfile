#
# Eidetic OS — minimal container for the `eidetic` CLI tools.
#
# There is no bundled dashboard application to serve (the public repo ships only
# a static, single-file ops dashboard at templates/ops-dashboard.html). This
# image instead packages the `eidetic` command and the pipeline scripts so you can
# run the vault/RAG/git/health tooling in an isolated, reproducible environment.
#
# Build:
#   docker build -t eidetic-os .
#   docker build -t eidetic-os --build-arg EXTRAS=".[all]" .   # include trading + pdf
#
# Run (mount your vault, load your .env):
#   docker run --rm -it \
#     --env-file .env \
#     -v "$HOME/Documents/Obsidian/MyVault:/vault" \
#     -e VAULT_PATH=/vault \
#     eidetic-os doctor
#
# A local LLM on the host (LM Studio / Ollama) is reachable from the container at
# host.docker.internal — set EMBED_HOST=host.docker.internal in your .env.
