# Scheduled Tasks

Atlas OS automations are Claude Cowork **skills** run on a schedule. Each lives
in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. The fastest way to install one is the CLI, which
copies the SKILL.md into your scheduled-tasks directory and fills in the
`{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens from your `.env`:

```bash
atlas skills list                       # every available skill (slug + cadence)
atlas skills show atlas-daily-report-email   # print a skill's SKILL.md
atlas skills install atlas-daily-report-email
```

`install` writes to `$ATLAS_SKILLS_DIR/<name>/SKILL.md` (default
`$VAULT_PATH/.claude/skills/<name>/`), substitutes every placeholder it can
resolve from the environment, and tells you which tokens it left for you to fill
in by hand. Pass `--force` to overwrite an existing install. Then register it on
the cadence below. (You can still copy the folder manually if you prefer.)

## Placeholders used across skills

`atlas skills install` resolves each `{{TOKEN}}` from the environment variable of
the same name (so `{{VAULT_PATH}}` ← `VAULT_PATH`). Two are special-cased:
`{{ATLAS_OS}}` resolves to this repo's path automatically, and `{{LLM_PORT}}`
reads `LM_STUDIO_PORT`. Tokens with no value (e.g. `{{JOB_TRACKER_PATH}}`,
`{{WATCHLIST}}`) are left in place for you to edit.

| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{{VAULT_PATH}}` | Absolute path to your vault |
| `{{ATLAS_OS}}` | Absolute path to this repo |
| `{{USER_EMAIL}}` | Where reports are sent |
| `{{EMBED_HOST}}` / `{{EMBED_PORT}}` | Local embeddings endpoint |
| `{{LLM_PORT}}` | Local chat-completions port |
| `{{JOB_TRACKER_PATH}}` | Your job-tracker `.xlsx` (keep outside the repo) |
| `{{WATCHLIST}}` | Companies/recruiters or tickers you track |
| `{{NEWSLETTER_BRAND}}` | Your newsletter name |
| `{{READER_ROLE}}` | Perspective the newsletter is written for |

## The tasks

| Skill | Suggested cadence | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `nightly-obsidian-index` | Nightly (e.g. 02:00) | Index new/changed notes, sync the wiki to 100% coverage, append the hot cache, commit the vault, write a morning briefing |
| `nightly-rag-incremental` | Nightly (after the index) | Embed only notes changed since the last run |
| `daily-session-capture` | Nightly (~23:30) | Save the day's Cowork chat transcripts to the vault as session-log notes |
| `daily-job-tracker-update` | Weekday mornings | Scan email for application updates; update the tracker |
| `afternoon-job-tracker-update` | Weekday ~14:00 | Catch afternoon emails; update the tracker |
| `atlas-daily-report-email` | Daily (e.g. 09:30) | Email a status report (job search, system health, action items) |
| `daily-trading-report` | Daily (e.g. 13:00) | Run the analyst agents on your watchlist; email a research report |
| `friday-it-newsletter` | Fridays AM | Compile and email a weekly IT-news digest; save to the vault |
| `weekly-system-health-check` | Weekly | Probe every subsystem; email a health report; auto-fix safe issues |
| `weekly-rag-full-reembed` | Weekly (e.g. Sun early AM) | Re-embed the entire vault from scratch |

> The job-tracker, trading, and newsletter tasks are entirely optional and only
> useful if those workflows apply to you. Start with the index + RAG + health
> tasks and add others as needed.

## The skills catalog (agent discovery)

Atlas OS keeps a **Skills Catalog** note inside your vault — a single,
always-current index of every skill this install ships. Its purpose is
*discovery*: any agent that reads or searches your vault (via RAG, or by opening
the note directly) can see the full menu of automations it can invoke, without
you having to describe them each time.

```bash
atlas skills          # list the catalog in the terminal
atlas skills --sync   # (re)generate "Skills Catalog.md" in your vault
```

`atlas init` generates it for you on first setup. The note is built from each
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` frontmatter (its `name` and `description`), so it never
drifts from the actual skills — **re-run `atlas skills --sync` whenever you add,
remove, or edit a skill**. It's auto-generated, so don't hand-edit it.

The catalog lands at `Skills Catalog.md` in the vault root (override with
`atlas skills --sync --output PATH`) and carries `type: reference` frontmatter so
the RAG indexer picks it up like any other note. Because it's just a vault note,
it's covered by the same local-first guarantees as everything else — it never
leaves your machine.

> Adding your own skill? Drop a `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` with `name` and
> `description` frontmatter, then `atlas skills --sync`. It appears in the
> catalog automatically.

## Notes on safety

- Job-tracker and trading tasks touch **confidential** data (see
  [`DATA-CLASSIFICATION.md`](DATA-CLASSIFICATION.md)). Keep those files outside
  this repo and never commit them.
- Tasks that send email need `SENDER_EMAIL` and `SMTP_APP_PASSWORD` in the
  environment — never inline credentials in a `SKILL.md`.
- Each task is written to run unattended: it makes reasonable choices rather than
  asking questions. Review the prompt before enabling it so you're comfortable
  with what it will do.
