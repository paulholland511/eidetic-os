## Adding your own

These skills are a starting menu, not a fixed set. To add a capability or a new
automation, drop a `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` with `name` + `description`
frontmatter and a numbered-step body, then run `atlas skills --sync` to
regenerate the in-vault `Skills Catalog.md` so agents can discover it. See
[**SKILLS-FRAMEWORK.md**](SKILLS-FRAMEWORK.md) for the anatomy, lifecycle, and a
copy-paste template, and the
[**skill-creator**](SKILLS-FRAMEWORK.md#creating-a-custom-skill) meta-skill for
scaffolding one.
