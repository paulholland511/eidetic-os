# Architecture

Atlas OS is a thin, local-first layer that turns Claude Cowork into a personal
operating system over a markdown knowledge vault. It is deliberately
file-based: the "database" is a folder of `.md` files, the "API" is a set of
small Python scripts fronted by the unified **`atlas` CLI** (`atlas_os/`), and
the "scheduler" is a set of skill prompts run on a cron-like schedule. Both you
and the scheduled skills drive everything through the one `atlas` command.

```

Session capture closes the loop: conversations and research done in Cowork are
written back into the vault (`sessions/`), where the RAG pipeline indexes them
alongside your notes — so the system's knowledge grows with every chat.

## Components

### 0. The `atlas` CLI (`atlas_os/`)
The single entry point. A [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) app that
auto-loads `.env`, validates each command's required env vars up front, and
wraps the pipeline scripts (`atlas embed`, `graph`, `commit`, `changelog`,
`health`, `email`, `trading`, `schemas`) plus CLI-only commands (`init`,
`doctor`, `skills`). Installed via `pip install -e .` (or `uv tool install` /
`pipx`); `pyproject.toml` declares the `atlas` entry point and the optional
dependency groups (`[pdf]`, `[trading]`, `[all]`). The same scripts remain
runnable directly, so the CLI is a convenience layer, not a hard dependency.

### 1. Knowledge vault
A plain folder of markdown notes (works great with Obsidian, but not required).
Top-level folders carry meaning (`research`, `projects`, `decisions`, `memory`,
`wiki`, `daily`, …) and drive the frontmatter schemas. Git-tracked for history.

### 2. Session capture (`scripts/save_sessions.py`)
Folds Cowork chat transcripts back into the vault as `sessions/session-log-*.md`
notes — a summary, the key actions, and the files touched, all extracted
**locally with no LLM call**. A watermark (`.atlas/last_session_save.txt`) makes
runs incremental, and the twice-daily capture skills keep it current. Because the
notes land in the vault as ordinary markdown, the RAG pipeline (below) indexes
them automatically — this is what makes every conversation, and the research the
deep-research skills write into the vault, permanently searchable.

### 3. RAG pipeline (`scripts/embed_vault.py`, `build_graph.py`, `atlas_os/vectordb.py`)
Chunks notes (~500 tokens, 50 overlap), embeds them via a **local**
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and stores vectors in a **SQLite** database
(`.rag/vectors.db`) through `atlas_os.vectordb.VectorStore`. One row per chunk
holds the text, metadata, and packed `float32` embedding together, so embeds are
incremental (insert/delete by file) rather than a full-file rewrite, and a crash
mid-run leaves every committed batch intact. Vector search uses the
[`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec) extension's k-nearest-neighbour
index when it's installed, and transparently falls back to a NumPy (or pure-Python)
cosine scan otherwise — same API, same scores, no hard dependency. Hybrid search
(vector + keyword) and metadata filtering run at query time. A legacy
`vectors.json` is auto-migrated to `vectors.db` on first embed (or ahead of time
via `atlas migrate-vectors`). `build_graph.py` derives a wikilink knowledge graph.
Both run incrementally (nightly) and fully (weekly), indexing your notes, captured
sessions, and research findings into one searchable corpus.

### 4. Frontmatter schemas (`schemas/enforce_schemas.py`)
Non-destructive enforcement of per-folder YAML frontmatter so notes stay
consistent. See [`../schemas/frontmatter-schemas.md`](../schemas/frontmatter-schemas.md).

### 5. Scheduled tasks (`skills/*`)
Each is a `SKILL.md` prompt run on a schedule by Claude Cowork: nightly index +
RAG embed, twice-daily session capture, daily reports, weekly health check and
full re-embed, etc. They orchestrate the scripts above and your connected MCP
tools. See [`SCHEDULED-TASKS.md`](SCHEDULED-TASKS.md).

### 6. Git automation (`scripts/vault_commit.py`, `vault_changelog.py`)
Auto-commits the vault with categorised messages and produces changelogs for the
morning briefing.

### 7. Email (`scripts/send_email.py`)
A credential-free SMTP sender (password from env) used by the report tasks.

### 8. Trading SDK (`trading/`, optional)
A multi-agent market-research framework that writes briefings into the vault.
Entirely optional and **not financial advice**.

### 9. Dashboard (`dashboard/`)
A static HTML overview that reads from your own local backend endpoints.

## Design principles

- **Local-first.** Notes and embeddings never leave the machine by default.
- **Config via environment.** No paths, hosts, emails, or secrets in code.
- **Files over databases.** Everything is inspectable, diffable, and portable.
- **Idempotent automations.** Re-running a task converges rather than duplicates.
- **Non-destructive.** Scripts add/append; the hot cache is append-only.

## Deployment

Atlas OS runs three ways, all from the same source: a **source checkout**
(`pip install -e .`), an **installed tool** (`uv tool install` / `pipx`, which
bundles the scripts/schemas/templates into the wheel — see
[`atlas_os/_paths.py`](../atlas_os/_paths.py)), or a **container**. The root
[`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile) (Python 3.11-slim + git) packages the CLI and
[`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml) bind-mounts your vault and loads
`.env` at runtime — no secrets or vault data are baked into the image. There is
no long-running service: it's a CLI, so containers run one subcommand and exit.
