# Changelog

All notable changes to Atlas OS are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Tutorial: *Your first 24 hours with Atlas OS*.** A new end-to-end guide,
  [`docs/TUTORIAL.md`](docs/TUTORIAL.md), walks a brand-new user from
  `pip install atlas-os` to a fully autonomous system — structured as a timeline
  (Hour 0 install & init → Hour 1 first vault & commit → Hour 2 RAG vectors &
  knowledge graph → Hour 3 skills & scheduled tasks → Hour 4 email reports →
  Hours 5–24 going autonomous). Every command is copy-pasteable with a "what you
  should see" check, and it assumes no prior knowledge of Obsidian, RAG, or
  embeddings. Linked from the root [`README.md`](README.md) and the docs
  [index](docs/README.md).
- **Production hardening for the pipeline scripts.** Every script under
  [`scripts/`](scripts) now degrades gracefully instead of dumping a traceback,
  backed by five new reusable modules:
  - [`atlas_os/retry.py`](atlas_os/retry.py) — a `RetryPolicy` plus a `retry`
    decorator and `retry_call` helper for exponential-backoff retries with an
    injectable `sleep` (so tests stay instant);
  - [`atlas_os/netio.py`](atlas_os/netio.py) — HTTP with explicit `(10s, 30s)`
    connect/read timeouts, retries on transient failures and `429/5xx`, and clear
    *"X at host:port is not responding"* errors (`EndpointUnreachable` /
    `HTTPStatusError`) rather than raw `requests` tracebacks;
  - [`atlas_os/fileio.py`](atlas_os/fileio.py) — atomic writes
    (write-temp → `fsync` → `os.replace`) for critical files like `vectors.json`
    and `graph.json`, plus reads that turn missing / permission-denied /
    iCloud-offloaded (`EDEADLK`, dataless stub) / corrupt-JSON cases into typed
    errors or a caller-supplied default;
  - [`atlas_os/gitutil.py`](atlas_os/gitutil.py) — stale lock cleanup
    (`index.lock`, `HEAD.lock`, ref locks) and `worktree prune` before writes,
    repo detection, and timeout-guarded command running (`GitError`);
  - [`atlas_os/scriptkit.py`](atlas_os/scriptkit.py) — consistent exit codes
    (`0` success, `1` error, `2` config), `--json` structured error output, and
    an `error_boundary` context manager that converts any exception into a
    one-line message — no script ever shows a user a Python traceback.

  Wired through: `embed_vault` (retrying timeout-bounded embeddings + atomic
  vector store + fail-fast on a down endpoint), `trading_briefing` (clear
  endpoint errors, `--json`, atomic briefing write), `send_email` (SMTP timeout
  and backoff retries on transient failures), `vault_commit` /
  `vault_changelog` (lock cleanup, not-a-repo detection, clean git errors),
  `build_graph` (atomic graph write), and `health_check` (HEAD/ref lock
  detection, traceback-free). New unit suites cover every module
  ([`test_retry`](tests/test_retry.py), [`test_netio`](tests/test_netio.py),
  [`test_fileio`](tests/test_fileio.py), [`test_gitutil`](tests/test_gitutil.py),
  [`test_scriptkit`](tests/test_scriptkit.py)).
- **End-to-end integration test suite.** A new
  [`tests/test_integration.py`](tests/test_integration.py) drives the real
  `atlas` CLI through Typer's `CliRunner` and exercises the pipelines as a user
  would — no mocked internals. Commands that wrap a script genuinely shell out to
  a subprocess; only the truly external dependencies (the LLM endpoint and SMTP)
  are stubbed, and those with **real local sockets** (a background
  OpenAI-compatible HTTP server, a refused SMTP port) so the child processes see
  them. The ten scenarios cover the full surface: `init → doctor`, the embed
  pipeline writing `vectors.json`, the git `commit` cycle, `changelog`
  generation, `skills list → install` with placeholder substitution, the audit
  trail round-trip, `health --json` structure, multi-backend detection, email
  graceful-failure paths, and a `init → embed → commit → changelog → audit` full
  lifecycle. New shared fixtures in [`tests/conftest.py`](tests/conftest.py)
  (`sample_vault`, `git_vault`, `llm_server`) build throwaway vaults and mock
  endpoints. Tests are marked `@pytest.mark.integration` so they can be run or
  skipped on their own (`pytest -m integration` / `pytest -m "not integration"`).
- **Interactive `atlas init` wizard.** First-run onboarding is now a guided,
  colourful wizard rather than hand-editing `.env`. It opens with a short
  explanation of what Atlas OS is, then: (1) suggests a **smart vault default**
  — an existing `~/Documents/Obsidian/*` folder, `~/vault`, or the current
  directory if it looks like a vault; (2) **auto-detects a local LLM** by probing
  LM Studio (`:5555`), Ollama (`:11434`), and llama.cpp (`:8080`), wiring the
  first match's host/port and embedding model into the config; (3) optionally
  collects **SMTP** settings for email reports; (4) **generates `.env`** from the
  answers; (5) **scaffolds the vault tree** (`.atlas/`, `.rag/`, `wiki/`) plus
  the index files and skills catalog, and git-inits the vault; (6) runs
  **`atlas doctor`** automatically and prints a "you're ready" summary with next
  steps. `--yes` accepts every default for a fully non-interactive run (fresh
  machines, scripts, containers), `--vault PATH` sets the vault explicitly, and
  `--force` overwrites an existing `.env`. The `doctor` checks were extracted
  into a reusable `_doctor_results()` so the wizard and the standalone command
  share one source of truth. Endpoint probing
  ([`atlas_os/_probe.py`](atlas_os/_probe.py)) was realigned to the documented
  default ports and now de-duplicates a server that answers on more than one API
  path. Covered by new tests in
  [`tests/test_cli.py`](tests/test_cli.py); the
  [Quick Start](docs/QUICKSTART.md) leads with the wizard.
- **Automated PyPI publishing via GitHub Actions + Trusted Publishing.** Pushing
  a `v*` tag (e.g. `v0.4.0`) now builds, tests, and publishes the release to
  PyPI with no stored token — authentication is
  [OIDC Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/).
  [`.github/workflows/publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml) runs
  `test → build → publish`: lint + `pytest`, then `python -m build` +
  `twine check`, then `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` against the `pypi`
  environment with `id-token: write`. A companion
  [`.github/workflows/test-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/test-publish.yml)
  routes pre-release tags (`v*rc*`, `v*dev*`) to TestPyPI for dress rehearsals.
  [`docs/PUBLISHING.md`](docs/PUBLISHING.md) documents the flow and the one-time
  PyPI trusted-publisher setup (pending-publisher or manual-first-upload).
- **`atlas skills install <name>`** — one-command skill deployment. Copies a
  skill's `SKILL.md` into your scheduled-tasks directory (`$ATLAS_SKILLS_DIR`,
  default `$VAULT_PATH/.claude/skills/<name>/`) and substitutes its
  `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens from the environment / `.env`. Most tokens map to the
  env var of the same name (`{{VAULT_PATH}}` ← `VAULT_PATH`); `{{ATLAS_OS}}`
  resolves to the repo path and `{{LLM_PORT}}` reads `LM_STUDIO_PORT`. Tokens
  with no value are left in place and reported so you can fill them by hand;
  `--force` overwrites an existing install. Two companion subcommands:
  `atlas skills list` (every available skill) and `atlas skills show <name>`
  (print a skill's `SKILL.md`). The placeholder logic and install live in
  [`atlas_os/_skills.py`](atlas_os/_skills.py), covered by
  [`tests/test_skills.py`](tests/test_skills.py).
- **PyPI release preparation.** The package is now publish-ready: the version is
  single-sourced from `__version__` in
  [`atlas_os/__init__.py`](atlas_os/__init__.py) via `[tool.hatch.version]`
  (bump it in one place), the sdist explicitly bundles `scripts/`, `schemas/`,
  `templates/`, `skills/`, and `docs/` (`[tool.hatch.build.targets.sdist]`), and
  the metadata gained AI/indexing topic classifiers. A new
  [`docs/PUBLISHING.md`](docs/PUBLISHING.md) is the maintainer runbook (bump →
  `python -m build` → `twine check` → TestPyPI → `twine upload` → tag). No
  release is published yet — everything is staged so `pipx install atlas-os`
  works the moment it is.
- **Pluggable LLM backends** ([`atlas_os/backends.py`](atlas_os/backends.py)).
  Atlas OS now auto-detects any OpenAI-compatible LLM server, probing **LM Studio
  (`:5555`) → Ollama (`:11434`) → llama.cpp (`:8080`) → a custom
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_URL`** in that order and using the first that responds. The
  module exposes `detect_backend()`, `get_client()`, `list_models()`, and a
  one-shot `run_inference()` test. Two env vars override the defaults:
  `ATLAS_LLM_BACKEND` forces a backend (`lmstudio`/`ollama`/`llamacpp`/
  `openai-compatible`, skipping detection) and `ATLAS_LLM_MODEL` overrides the
  chat model name. New CLI: `atlas backends` lists every backend with
  reachability + models, and `atlas backends test` runs an end-to-end inference.
  The RAG (`embed_vault.py`), trading (`trading_briefing.py`), and health
  (`health_check.py`) scripts now resolve their endpoint through this module.
  **Fully backward compatible:** explicit `EMBED_*` / `LM_STUDIO_*` settings still
  win, so existing setups are unchanged. Covered by
  [`tests/test_backends.py`](tests/test_backends.py).
- **Skills catalogue & framework docs.** A
  [`docs/SKILLS-CATALOGUE.md`](docs/SKILLS-CATALOGUE.md) documenting the full menu
  of **160+ skills** — 149 capability skills across seven domains (Security,
  DevOps, Frontend, Backend, Quality, Data & AI, Business), each with a one-line
  summary, what it does, and when to use it, plus the four Atlas-native skills
  (`autoresearch`, `save-to-vault`, `wiki-search`, `send-email`) and the nine
  scheduled automations. A companion
  [`docs/SKILLS-FRAMEWORK.md`](docs/SKILLS-FRAMEWORK.md) explains what a skill is,
  the anatomy of a `SKILL.md`, the placeholder-token system, the lifecycle
  (creation → installation → scheduling → execution → audit logging), how the
  RAG-indexed catalog reaches sub-agents, the `skill-creator` meta-skill, and a
  copy-paste `SKILL.md` template. Everything is generic and `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`-
  tokenised — no personal data.
- **Six example skills** ([`skills/`](skills)) demonstrating the framework across
  document creation (`generate-vault-report-doc`), email automation
  (`inbox-triage-digest`), data analysis (`spreadsheet-analysis`), web research
  (`topic-research-brief`), vault management (`vault-lint-report`), and report
  generation (`weekly-digest-report`) — bringing the shipped skill count to 15.
- **Audit trail** ([`atlas_os/audit.py`](atlas_os/audit.py)). An append-only
  JSONL log of every autonomous action, written to `$ATLAS_AUDIT_PATH` (default
  `$VAULT_PATH/.atlas/audit.jsonl`). Each entry records the timestamp, action,
  trigger (`scheduled`/`manual`/`cli`), status, duration, what changed, why it
  ran, and any error. Appends are serialised with an in-process lock plus an
  OS-level advisory file lock (safe across concurrent `atlas` processes) and the
  file auto-rotates at 10 MB to `audit.jsonl.1`, `.2`, …. Every script-wrapping
  command (`embed`, `commit`, `graph`, `changelog`, `health`, `trading`,
  `email`) now logs its outcome automatically; scheduled tasks tag their runs by
  setting `ATLAS_TRIGGER=scheduled`. New `atlas audit` subcommands: `show`
  (`--limit`/`--action`/`--since`), `tail` (last 5, compact), and `export`
  (`--format csv|json`, `--output`) for compliance reporting. Strengthens ISO
  27001 control A.12.4 (logging & monitoring). Covered by
  [`tests/test_audit.py`](tests/test_audit.py).
- **GitHub issue & PR templates**
  ([`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/),
  [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)) — a
  structured bug report (with an environment block: OS, Python, Atlas OS
  version, install method), a feature request (use case / proposed solution /
  alternatives), and a PR checklist (tests, docs, the PII scan). An
  `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` disables blank issues and routes security reports
  to `SECURITY.md` and questions to the FAQ.
- **README status badges** — GitHub Actions CI status, GitHub stars, and
  last-commit, alongside the existing license / Python / privacy / docs badges.
- **`atlas trading`** — wraps `scripts/trading_briefing.py` (`--ticker`,
  `--date`, `--dry-run`); the last optional pipeline script to gain a first-class
  subcommand, so the whole system is now reachable through one `atlas` command.
- **Up-front env validation.** Every vault/optional command checks its required
  environment variables before shelling out and exits with a clear message and a
  non-zero code if any are missing — a half-configured feature fails fast instead
  of part-way through.
- **`atlas email` flags.** Send mail with `--to` / `--subject` / `--body`
  (`--text` for plain text, repeatable `--attach`), or the original raw payload
  via `--json`.
- **Docker support.** A minimal [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) (Python 3.11-slim +
  git) that packages the `atlas` CLI, a [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml)
  that bind-mounts your vault and loads `.env`, and a `.dockerignore`. Run any
  subcommand in a container without installing Python tooling on the host.
  Build-tested end-to-end (`atlas --version` / `doctor` / `commit` against a
  bind-mounted vault), with three fixes from that pass: copy the
  `scripts/schemas/templates/skills` dirs *before* `pip install` (the wheel
  force-includes them, so the build failed without them); `git config --global
  --add safe.directory` so git operations work on a vault owned by a non-root
  host user (avoids "dubious ownership"); and an optional `env_file` so compose
  runs before a `.env` exists.
- **CLI tests** ([`tests/test_cli.py`](tests/test_cli.py)) covering `--version`,
  every registered subcommand, and the env-validation guards.
- **Core vs optional** section in [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md) separating the
  always-available core (vault, commit, changelog, schemas, health) from opt-in
  features (RAG/embeddings, trading, email, LM Studio, dashboard) with each one's
  extra deps and env vars, plus a Docker quick-start.
- **Automated test suite** in [`tests/`](tests/) — 74 hermetic `pytest` tests
  covering the core scripts (`embed_vault`, `build_graph`, `health_check`,
  `send_email`, `vault_commit`, `vault_changelog`, `trading_briefing`). They stub
  every external dependency (network, SMTP, git, and the optional
  `tradingagents` package) and point `VAULT_PATH`/`RAG_DIR` at a temp directory,
  so they need no env vars, no network, and never touch a real vault.
- **GitHub Actions CI** ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml))
  — runs ruff, pytest, and pip-audit on every push and pull request to `main`.
- **Development & testing** section in the README and dev/CI tooling (`pytest`,
  `ruff`, `pip-audit`) added to `requirements.txt`.
- **Feature deep-dive docs** in [`docs/features/`](docs/features/README.md) — one
  per feature, explaining how it actually works (internals, data formats,
  configuration, edge cases), grounded in the source: knowledge vault & schemas,
  local RAG search, knowledge graph, git automation, scheduled tasks & skills
  catalog, email reports, trading SDK, and health check & dashboard. Linked from
  the README and the docs index.

### Changed
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` expanded** into a full contributor guide — dev-environment
  setup, running the test/lint/audit suite, code style, the PR workflow, and a
  project-structure overview — on top of the existing "golden rule" (never
  commit personal data) and PII scan.
- **README**: documented `atlas trading`, the new `atlas email` flags,
  env-validation behaviour, a Docker section (+ a Docker pointer under
  Installation), the Docker files in the repo-layout diagram, and updated the
  `.github/` layout line to note the issue/PR templates.
- **Docs sync across the set** to match the streamlined CLI:
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — added the `atlas` CLI as component 0 (the unified
    entry point) and a Deployment section covering checkout / installed tool /
    Docker.
  - `docs/EXAMPLES.md`, `docs/features/email-reports.md` — updated every
    `atlas email` example to the new flags (with `--json` for raw payloads),
    fixing samples that the flag change would otherwise have broken.
  - `docs/QUICKSTART.md` — corrected the minimum Python to 3.11+ and linked the
    Docker quick-start.
  - `docs/README.md` (docs index) — linked the SETUP core-vs-optional matrix and
    the Docker files.
  - `SECURITY.md` — added a "Running in containers (Docker)" section (no secrets
    or vault data in the image; runtime-only `--env-file`; bind-mounted vault).
- **`pyproject.toml`** continues to declare the `atlas` entry point and the
  optional dependency groups (`[pdf]`, `[trading]`, `[all]`); these are now the
  documented install path (`pip install -e ".[all]"`) for the optional features.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Agent skills catalog.** A self-updating `Skills Catalog.md` note generated
  into the vault, listing every skill (name, description, suggested cadence)
  read from each `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter — so agents reading or
  searching the vault can discover what automations they can invoke. Carries
  `type: reference` frontmatter so the RAG indexer picks it up.
- **`atlas skills`** — list the catalog in the terminal; `atlas skills --sync`
  (re)generates the note in the vault (`--output` to override the path).
  `atlas init` now generates it automatically on setup.
- The `skills/` directory is bundled into the wheel so the catalog works in an
  installed `atlas` without the source checkout.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Installable package** with a unified **`atlas` CLI** (`pyproject.toml`,
  `atlas_os/`). Install via `uv tool install` / `pipx` / `pip install -e .`.
  Subcommands `embed`, `graph`, `commit`, `changelog`, `health`, `email`, and
  `schemas` wrap the existing scripts and forward their flags; configuration
  (`.env`) is auto-loaded.
- **`atlas init`** — guided onboarding: auto-detects a local LLM (LM Studio /
  Ollama / any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), writes `.env`, scaffolds the vault
  skeleton, initialises the vault git repo, and optionally installs the
  `CLAUDE.md` template. Supports `--vault`, `--yes`, `--force`.
- **`atlas doctor`** — validates the whole setup (Python, vault, git, RAG
  index, embeddings endpoint, SMTP) and reports OK / WARN / FAIL with a
  non-zero exit on failures.
- Optional dependency extras: `atlas-os[trading]` (yfinance),
  `atlas-os[pdf]` (pdfplumber), `atlas-os[all]`.
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` — authoritative reference for every environment
  variable (purpose, default, required/optional, consuming scripts).
- `docs/SCRIPTS.md` — complete CLI reference for all scripts and their flags,
  including the previously-undocumented `embed_vault.py` flags
  (`--incremental`, `--folder`, `--pdfs-only`, `--checkpoint-interval`,
  `--batch-size`).
- `docs/FAQ.md` — frequently asked questions and troubleshooting.
- `docs/README.md` — documentation index and recommended reading order.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.

### Changed
- The scripts/schemas/templates are now bundled into the wheel (under
  `atlas_os_data/`) so an installed `atlas` works without the source checkout;
  in a source checkout the CLI uses the live files.
- `.env.example` now documents `LM_STUDIO_URL` (used by
  `scripts/trading_briefing.py`, expects a `/v1` suffix) alongside
  `LM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT` (used by `trading/config.py`/`core.py`, no suffix),
  clarifying which script reads which.
- Root `README.md` expanded with the install/CLI quick start, a CLI command
  table, badges, a documentation map, and a configuration pointer.
- `docs/SETUP.md` restructured into "install the package" (recommended) vs
  "run from a source checkout".

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- Initial public release of Atlas OS — a local-first personal AI operating
  system built on Claude Cowork.
- Knowledge vault conventions with per-folder frontmatter schema enforcement
  (`schemas/`).
- Local RAG pipeline (`scripts/embed_vault.py`) and wikilink knowledge graph
  (`scripts/build_graph.py`).
- Git automation: auto-commit (`scripts/vault_commit.py`) and changelog
  (`scripts/vault_changelog.py`).
- Credential-free SMTP email sender (`scripts/send_email.py`).
- System health check across all subsystems (`scripts/health_check.py`).
- Optional multi-agent trading research SDK (`trading/`) and briefing generator
  (`scripts/trading_briefing.py`).
- Nine Claude Cowork scheduled-task skills (`skills/`).
- Templates for `CLAUDE.md`, memory structure, vault skeleton, and a static ops
  dashboard (`templates/`, `dashboard/`).
- Documentation: setup, architecture, rebuild runbook, scheduled tasks, data
  classification; `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, MIT `LICENSE`.
