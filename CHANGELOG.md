# Changelog

All notable changes to Atlas OS are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`atlas trading`** — wraps `scripts/trading_briefing.py` (`--ticker`,
  `--date`, `--dry-run`); the last optional pipeline script to gain a first-class
  subcommand, so the whole system is now reachable through one `atlas` command.
- **Up-front env validation.** Every vault/optional command checks its required
  environment variables before shelling out and exits with a clear message and a
  non-zero code if any are missing — a half-configured feature fails fast instead
  of part-way through.
- **`atlas email` flags.** Send mail with `--to` / `--subject` / `--body`
  (`--text` for plain text, repeatable `--attach`), or the original raw payload
  via `--json`.
- **Docker support.** A minimal [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) (Python 3.11-slim +
  git) that packages the `atlas` CLI, a [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml)
  that bind-mounts your vault and loads `.env`, and a `.dockerignore`. Run any
  subcommand in a container without installing Python tooling on the host.
- **CLI tests** ([`tests/test_cli.py`](tests/test_cli.py)) covering `--version`,
  every registered subcommand, and the env-validation guards.
- **Core vs optional** section in [`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md) separating the
  always-available core (vault, commit, changelog, schemas, health) from opt-in
  features (RAG/embeddings, trading, email, LM Studio, dashboard) with each one's
  extra deps and env vars, plus a Docker quick-start.
- **Automated test suite** in [`tests/`](tests/) — 74 hermetic `pytest` tests
  covering the core scripts (`embed_vault`, `build_graph`, `health_check`,
  `send_email`, `vault_commit`, `vault_changelog`, `trading_briefing`). They stub
  every external dependency (network, SMTP, git, and the optional
  `tradingagents` package) and point `VAULT_PATH`/`RAG_DIR` at a temp directory,
  so they need no env vars, no network, and never touch a real vault.
- **GitHub Actions CI** ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml))
  — runs ruff, pytest, and pip-audit on every push and pull request to `main`.
- **Development & testing** section in the README and dev/CI tooling (`pytest`,
  `ruff`, `pip-audit`) added to `requirements.txt`.
- **Feature deep-dive docs** in [`docs/features/`](docs/features/README.md) — one
  per feature, explaining how it actually works (internals, data formats,
  configuration, edge cases), grounded in the source: knowledge vault & schemas,
  local RAG search, knowledge graph, git automation, scheduled tasks & skills
  catalog, email reports, trading SDK, and health check & dashboard. Linked from
  the README and the docs index.

### Changed
- README: documented `atlas trading`, the new `atlas email` flags, env-validation
  behaviour, a Docker section, and the Docker files in the repo-layout diagram.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Agent skills catalog.** A self-updating `Skills Catalog.md` note generated
  into the vault, listing every skill (name, description, suggested cadence)
  read from each `skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter — so agents reading or
  searching the vault can discover what automations they can invoke. Carries
  `type: reference` frontmatter so the RAG indexer picks it up.
- **`atlas skills`** — list the catalog in the terminal; `atlas skills --sync`
  (re)generates the note in the vault (`--output` to override the path).
  `atlas init` now generates it automatically on setup.
- The `skills/` directory is bundled into the wheel so the catalog works in an
  installed `atlas` without the source checkout.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Installable package** with a unified **`atlas` CLI** (`pyproject.toml`,
  `atlas_os/`). Install via `uv tool install` / `pipx` / `pip install -e .`.
  Subcommands `embed`, `graph`, `commit`, `changelog`, `health`, `email`, and
  `schemas` wrap the existing scripts and forward their flags; configuration
  (`.env`) is auto-loaded.
- **`atlas init`** — guided onboarding: auto-detects a local LLM (LM Studio /
  Ollama / any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), writes `.env`, scaffolds the vault
  skeleton, initialises the vault git repo, and optionally installs the
  `CLAUDE.md` template. Supports `--vault`, `--yes`, `--force`.
- **`atlas doctor`** — validates the whole setup (Python, vault, git, RAG
  index, embeddings endpoint, SMTP) and reports OK / WARN / FAIL with a
  non-zero exit on failures.
- Optional dependency extras: `atlas-os[trading]` (yfinance),
  `atlas-os[pdf]` (pdfplumber), `atlas-os[all]`.
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` — authoritative reference for every environment
  variable (purpose, default, required/optional, consuming scripts).
- `docs/SCRIPTS.md` — complete CLI reference for all scripts and their flags,
  including the previously-undocumented `embed_vault.py` flags
  (`--incremental`, `--folder`, `--pdfs-only`, `--checkpoint-interval`,
  `--batch-size`).
- `docs/FAQ.md` — frequently asked questions and troubleshooting.
- `docs/README.md` — documentation index and recommended reading order.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.

### Changed
- The scripts/schemas/templates are now bundled into the wheel (under
  `atlas_os_data/`) so an installed `atlas` works without the source checkout;
  in a source checkout the CLI uses the live files.
- `.env.example` now documents `LM_STUDIO_URL` (used by
  `scripts/trading_briefing.py`, expects a `/v1` suffix) alongside
  `LM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT` (used by `trading/config.py`/`core.py`, no suffix),
  clarifying which script reads which.
- Root `README.md` expanded with the install/CLI quick start, a CLI command
  table, badges, a documentation map, and a configuration pointer.
- `docs/SETUP.md` restructured into "install the package" (recommended) vs
  "run from a source checkout".

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- Initial public release of Atlas OS — a local-first personal AI operating
  system built on Claude Cowork.
- Knowledge vault conventions with per-folder frontmatter schema enforcement
  (`schemas/`).
- Local RAG pipeline (`scripts/embed_vault.py`) and wikilink knowledge graph
  (`scripts/build_graph.py`).
- Git automation: auto-commit (`scripts/vault_commit.py`) and changelog
  (`scripts/vault_changelog.py`).
- Credential-free SMTP email sender (`scripts/send_email.py`).
- System health check across all subsystems (`scripts/health_check.py`).
- Optional multi-agent trading research SDK (`trading/`) and briefing generator
  (`scripts/trading_briefing.py`).
- Nine Claude Cowork scheduled-task skills (`skills/`).
- Templates for `CLAUDE.md`, memory structure, vault skeleton, and a static ops
  dashboard (`templates/`, `dashboard/`).
- Documentation: setup, architecture, rebuild runbook, scheduled tasks, data
  classification; `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, MIT `LICENSE`.
