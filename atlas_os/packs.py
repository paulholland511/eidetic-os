"""Pre-built **skill packs** — curated bundles of related skills.

A *pack* groups skills that together set up a complete workflow, so you can
install an entire workflow with one command (``atlas skills install-pack
<name>``) instead of installing each skill one at a time. Packs reference skills
by their folder slug; :func:`install_pack` simply runs the per-skill installer
(:func:`atlas_os._skills.install_skill`) for every member, with the same
``{{PLACEHOLDER}}`` substitution.

The registry below is the single source of truth. Each pack's ``skills`` must
name real skills under ``skills/`` — :func:`validate_packs` checks this and the
test-suite asserts it, so a typo'd slug fails CI rather than at install time.
