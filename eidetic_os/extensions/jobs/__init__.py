"""The jobs extension — job-search tracking as an optional module.

A placeholder for a job-application tracker that lives in the vault: applications
as markdown notes, status tracking, and scheduled reminders to follow up. Kept
out of the core because job-hunting is a temporary, personal workflow rather than
part of the knowledge-management substrate.

The command surface is stubbed: ``eidetic jobs list`` and ``eidetic jobs add``
register and explain themselves so the extension contract and CLI wiring are
exercised while the tracker is built out. Install the (currently empty) extra
with ``pip install 'eidetic-os[jobs]'``.
