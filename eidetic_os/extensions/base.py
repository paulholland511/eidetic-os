"""The extension contract — :class:`EideticExtension`.

An *extension* is an optional, domain-specific bundle of functionality that
plugs into the lean Eidetic OS core (vault parsing, git sync, RAG, CLI, dashboard,
audit trail) without the core ever importing it. Trading, voice/TTS, and the job
tracker are the bundled examples; a third-party package can ship its own by
exposing a subclass under the ``eidetic_os.extensions`` entry-point group.

The core only ever sees this abstract surface. An extension declares its
identity (``name`` / ``description``) and may hook into four extension points:

* **commands** — add subcommands to the ``eidetic`` Typer app
  (``register_commands``);
* **skills** — contribute scheduled-task skill definitions
  (``register_skills``);
* **schedules** — contribute cron-like schedule definitions
  (``register_schedules``);
* **lifecycle** — run setup/teardown when loaded or unloaded
  (``on_load`` / ``on_unload``).

Every hook except the two identity properties has a no-op default, so a minimal
extension only has to implement ``name`` and ``description``.
