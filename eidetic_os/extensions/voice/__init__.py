"""The voice extension — text-to-speech as an optional module.

A placeholder for speaking Eidetic OS output aloud through a local TTS engine
(e.g. an MLX TTS server on ``localhost:8800`` piped to ``afplay``). Kept out of
the core because TTS is a personal, platform-specific concern that most users
won't want, and the core has no audio dependencies.

The command surface is stubbed: ``eidetic voice say`` and ``eidetic voice status``
register and explain themselves, so the extension contract and CLI wiring can be
exercised end-to-end while the synthesis backend is filled in later. Install the
(currently empty) extra with ``pip install 'eidetic-os[voice]'``.
