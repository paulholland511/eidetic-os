"""Resilient git helpers for the vault automation scripts.

The nightly ``vault_commit`` / ``vault_changelog`` jobs run unattended against a
git repo that other processes (Obsidian Git, manual commits, a previous crashed
run) may have touched. The recurring failure modes are:

* a stale ``.git/index.lock`` / ``.git/HEAD.lock`` left by an interrupted git
  process, which makes every subsequent git command fail with
  *"Another git process seems to be running"*;
* the path simply not being a git repository;
* a git command failing and dumping a traceback on the caller.

This module centralises lock cleanup and command execution so the scripts get a
clean, structured result instead of a traceback.
