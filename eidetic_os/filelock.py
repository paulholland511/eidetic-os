"""Advisory file locking for vault writes.

Eidetic runs several writers against the same knowledge vault — the RAG indexer
embeds notes, the sync engine merges remote changes, session capture appends to
daily notes. When two of them touch the *same* file at the same time the later
write can silently clobber the earlier one. This module serialises those writers
with a simple, portable, **advisory** lock: a sibling ``<name>.lock`` file
created with ``O_EXCL`` (an atomic "create only if absent" on every POSIX
filesystem, including the iCloud-backed vault).

Design notes
------------
* **Atomic acquisition.** ``os.open(..., O_CREAT | O_EXCL)`` is the lock — only
  one process can win the create; everyone else gets ``FileExistsError`` and
  retries.
* **Retry with backoff.** :func:`acquire_lock` polls with exponential backoff up
  to ``timeout`` seconds, then raises :class:`LockTimeout` rather than blocking
  forever. The ``sleep`` function is injectable so tests run instantly.
* **Stale-lock recovery.** A process that crashes while holding a lock would wedge
  every future writer. A lock file whose mtime is older than
  :data:`STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` (5 minutes) is treated as abandoned and removed, so
  the system self-heals after a crash.
* **Diagnostics.** The lock file records the owner pid and an ISO-8601 timestamp,
  so a human (or ``eidetic doctor``) can see who holds it and since when.

Usage::
